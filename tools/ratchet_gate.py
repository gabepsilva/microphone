"""Fail when a quality threshold moves the wrong way.

Every other gate checks the code. This one checks the gates, because none of
them can stop an agent from editing the gate instead of satisfying it: a
lowered floor, a narrowed mutmut scope, or a deleted Semgrep rule all produce
a green run. That used to be prose in AGENTS.md asking politely; asking is not
a control.

Thresholds are read from the base branch and compared with the working tree.
Raising a floor is always allowed. Lowering one fails. A floor may be dropped
only when its source file is genuinely gone.

Suppression counts are deliberately not ratcheted: AGENTS.md permits a
`# noqa` or `# nosec` that carries a finding ID and a justification, so a
count-based gate would fire on legitimate use and be silenced.
